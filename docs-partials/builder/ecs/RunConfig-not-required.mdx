- `source_image` (string) - The ID of the base image to use. This is the image that will
  be used to launch a new server and provision it. Unless you specify
  completely custom SSH settings, the source image must have cloud-init
  installed so that the keypair gets assigned properly.

- `source_image_name` (string) - The name of the base image to use. This is an alternative way of
  providing source_image and only either of them can be specified.

- `source_image_filter` (ImageFilter) - Filters used to populate filter options. Example:
  
  ``` json {
      "source_image_filter": {
          "filters": {
              "name": "Ubuntu 18.04 server 64bit",
              "visibility": "public",
          },
          "most_recent": true
      }
  }
  ```
  
  This selects the most recent production Ubuntu 16.04 shared to you by
  the given owner. NOTE: This will fail unless *exactly* one image is
  returned, or `most_recent` is set to true. In the example of multiple
  returned images, `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting
  the newest image of the returned images.
  
  -   `filters` (map of strings) - filters used to select a
  `source_image`.
      NOTE: This will fail unless *exactly* one image is returned, or
      `most_recent` is set to true.
      The following filters are valid:
  
      -   name (string)
      -   owner (string)
      -   visibility (string)
  
  -   `most_recent` (boolean) - Selects the newest created image when
  true.
      This is most useful for selecting a daily distro build.
  
  You may set use this in place of `source_image` If `source_image_filter`
  is provided alongside `source_image`, the `source_image` will override
  the filter. The filter will not be used in this case.

- `availability_zone` (string) - The availability zone to launch the server in.
  If omitted, a random availability zone in the region will be used.

- `floating_ip` (string) - A specific floating IP to assign to this instance.

- `reuse_ips` (bool) - Whether or not to attempt to reuse existing unassigned floating ips in
  the project before allocating a new one. Note that it is not possible to
  safely do this concurrently, so if you are running multiple builds
  concurrently, or if other processes are assigning and using floating IPs
  in the same project while packer is running, you should not set this to true.
  Defaults to false.

- `eip_type` (string) - The type of eip. See the api doc to get the value.

- `eip_bandwidth_size` (int) - The size of eip bandwidth.

- `ssh_ip_version` (string) - The IP version to use for SSH connections, valid values are `4` and `6`.

- `vpc_id` (string) - A vpc id to attach to this instance.

- `subnets` ([]string) - A list of subnets by UUID to attach to this instance.

- `security_groups` ([]string) - A list of security groups by name to add to this instance.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to apply when launching the instance. Note that you need to be
  careful about escaping characters due to the templates being JSON. It is
  often more convenient to use user_data_file, instead. Packer will not
  automatically wait for a user script to finish before shutting down the
  instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user data when launching the
  instance.

- `instance_name` (string) - Name that is applied to the server instance created by Packer. If this
  isn't specified, the default is same as image_name.

- `instance_metadata` (map[string]string) - Metadata that is applied to the server instance created by Packer. Also
  called server properties in some documentation. The strings have a max
  size of 255 bytes each.

- `config_drive` (bool) - Whether or not nova should use ConfigDrive for cloud-init metadata.

- `enterprise_project_id` (string) - The ID of Enterprise Project in which to create the image.
  If omitted, the HW_ENTERPRISE_PROJECT_ID environment variable is used.

- `volume_type` (string) - The system disk type of the instance. Defaults to `SSD`.

- `volume_size` (int) - The system disk size in GB. If this parameter is not specified,
  it is set to the minimum value of the system disk in the source image.

- `data_disks` ([]DataVolume) - Add one or more data disks to the instance before creating the image.
  Usage example:
  
  ``` json {
    "data_disks": [
      {
        "volume_size": 100,
        "volume_type": "GPSSD"
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
  ```
  
  The data_disks allow for the following argument:
    -  `volume_size` (int, required) - The data disk size in GB.
    -  `volume_type` (string) - The data disk type of the instance. Defaults to `SSD`.

- `vault_id` (string) - The ID of the vault to which the instance is to be added.
  This parameter is **mandatory** when creating a full-ECS image from the instance.
